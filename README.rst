Introduction
============

To be quite honest, this is going to be a rather simplistic and messy client. I'm writing it because I'm fed up trying to decipher my mother's terrible handwriting on shopping lists and it would be much easier to read them off my phone while picking items off the shelves.

The intention, at present, is to create a simple desktop client to create and manage the shopping lists (this application) and in a separate project (slg_mobile) I will create a simple Android application to allow items to be checked off as they're picked. It is likely the desktop app will send an email containing the shopping list file for the phone to pickup, but this is subject to change when I realise it's a foolish way to go about it.

**This README will be updated when there's actually something to write up.**
